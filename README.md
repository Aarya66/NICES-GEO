# NICES-GEO
NICES GEO  is a natural language-based system developed during my internship at NRSC, ISRO. It enables users to query and analyze Earth observation data through text or voice, performing statistical operations and generating visualizations like maps and trend graphs for geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring.
